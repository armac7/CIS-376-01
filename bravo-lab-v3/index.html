<!--
  I made quite a few changes. First, I put all of the pictures inside the same divider, 
  organized them in a way that made more sense (without a scroll).
  I added hover text, with the help of google and messing around, so that each choice
  was evident as to what it was. I reorganized some of the styles and redid/removed
  some of them. I'm not happy with how it is organized because it is very
  amateur-ish. Regardless, quite happy with the page. I learned a lot from it.
  I also changed the fonts, and want to change how the text is stored, as well.

  <article id="text">Whatever it is, it is dragging you down, perhaps into the darkest pits<br>
                          you've ever been in. Your depression is out of control, your thoughts <br>
                          are perpetually negative, and life is at its all-time low. 
                          <br>
                          You've been thinking about where to go next.
                          <br><br>
                          Is this the end? Is it time to finally give up? 
                          <br>
                          From here, where else is there left to go? 
                          <br>
                          What else could there possibly be left to do.
                          <br>
                          You've been thinking about where to go next.
                          <br><br>
                          You sit for a moment, rain pounding against your skin,<br>
                          All around you goes silent except for the
                          droning cry of the rain. <br>
                          It is time to make a decision...
